    "As a Senior Software Engineer specializing in Flutter and Native Android, I bring over 6.5+ years of hands-on experience in delivering mobile applications that combine high performance, intuitive UX/UI design, and scalable architecture. At Tech Mahindra - Borngroup, I leverage my expertise to build seamless, cross-platform solutions that are both innovative and user-driven.\n\nI am passionate about creating robust and maintainable code, from architecting scalable mobile apps to integrating cutting-edge technologies like Flutter and KMM. My background as an ex-Android developer gives me a strong foundation in native app development, which I utilize to bridge the gap between platforms for a unified user experience. \n \n In addition to my full-time role, I thrive in freelance work, collaborating with diverse teams and projects that challenge the limits of mobile development.";
